            <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for Content</strong><br><br>
                The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As service providers, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7, para.1 TMG under general laws. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as service providers to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which knowledge of a specific legal violation becomes known. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will immediately remove such content.<br><br><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
                Our offering contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove such links.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
                The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law.

Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this page was not created by the operator, third-party copyrights are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove such content.<br><br><strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
                The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data.

This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. <br>
                We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible. <br>
                The use of contact data published within the framework of the legal notice obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the case of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.<br>
