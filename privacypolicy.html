            <strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)</strong> – Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> – Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany, in particular the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Liechtenstein:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, the Data Protection Act (DSG) and the Data Protection Ordinance (DSV) apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in the Netherlands:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, the implementing act to the GDPR (Uitvoeringswet Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming – UAVG) applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Austria:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, the Data Protection Act (DSG) applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Poland:</strong> In addition to the GDPR, the Data Protection Act (Ustawa z dnia 10 maja 2018 r. o ochronie danych osobowych) applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Applicable legal bases under the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP):</strong> Where applicable, processing is carried out in accordance with the Swiss FADP.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Note on applicability of the GDPR and Swiss FADP:</strong> These privacy notices serve both the GDPR and the Swiss FADP. For clarity, GDPR terminology is used.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          Appropriate technical and organizational measures are implemented to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Measures include ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, access, input, disclosure, availability and separation of data. Procedures for exercising data subjects' rights, deletion of data and responses to data threats have been established. Data protection by design and by default is considered when selecting hardware, software and procedures.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of processing personal data, data may be transferred to other entities, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons, or disclosed to them. Recipients may include IT service providers or providers of services and content integrated into a website. Legal requirements are observed and appropriate agreements for the protection of your data are concluded with recipients.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Processing in third countries: Where data is processed in a third country (outside the EU/EEA) or transferred to third parties, this is done in accordance with legal requirements. Where an adequacy decision exists (Art. 45 GDPR), it serves as the basis. Otherwise, transfers occur where safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or contractual/legal necessity apply. Information is provided for each third-country provider used. See EU Commission resources for adequacy decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF): Under the DPF, the EU Commission has recognized an adequate level of protection for certain US companies. Certified companies can be found at the U.S. Department of Commerce website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disclosure abroad under Swiss FADP: Personal data is disclosed abroad only when adequate protection is ensured (Art. 16 FADP). If no adequate protection is recognized by the Federal Council, alternative safeguards are implemented.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
        <p>
          Under the GDPR, data subjects have the rights to object, withdraw consent, access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
